# CS411-Project-Team4
CS411-Project-Team4 is working on a super cool project for class.

Idea 1
Chances-of-flight-cancellation app, where we take the user’s selected flight, query it, find the weather forecast in the departing and arriving cities, and return some calculated probability that the flight will be canceled. The user can store their info in a DB and we can require users to make an account. Requires a flight-path and weather API (AeroAPI and OpenWeather API). An e-mail will be sent to those users whose flight has a high probability of being canceled based on our forecast.

Idea 2

	Scan the barcode of a product and query it’s information, such as price, calories, etc. Can compare MSRP to in-store/online prices, add calories together, track product metadata and recommend similar products. Add food products to an ingredient list and query nutrition api to get full nutritional analysis on your meal.
