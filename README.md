# CS411-Project-Team4
CS411-Project-Team4 is working on a super cool project for class.

- Ideas:
    - The idea so far is a game that utilizes real world APIs to generate some kind of effect such as terrain, weather, etc. The game would store data in a DB and use Third Party Auth to register/authenticate a new/continuing user.
    - Chances-of-flight-cancellation app, where we take the userâ€™s selected flight, query it, find the weather forecast along the path and return some calculated probability that the flight will be cancelled. Or we can just return the average weather along the flight path. The user can store their info in a DB and we can require users to make an account. Requires a flight-path and weather API
