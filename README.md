## Idea

Chances-of-flight-cancellation app, where we take the userâ€™s selected flight, query it, find the weather forecast in the departing and arriving cities, and return some calculated probability that the flight will be canceled. The user can store their info in a DB and we can require users to make an account. Requires a flight-path and weather API (AeroAPI and OpenWeather API). An e-mail will be sent to those users whose flight has a high probability of being canceled based on our forecast.
