# CS411-Project-Team4
CS411-Project-Team4 is working on a super cool project for class. The idea so far is a game that utilizes real world APIs to generate some kind of effect such as terrain, weather, etc. The game would store data in a DB and use Third Party Auth to register/authenticate a new/continuing user.

- Weather on a map
- Currency/Tax api
